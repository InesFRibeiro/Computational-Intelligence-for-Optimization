### Description   
This project aimed to optimize a route between cities (TSP problem) using genetic algorithms.    
It was implemented and study which types of operations (selection, crossover, mutation etc.) work best for the TSP problem.
For the selection process we implemented the fitness proportionate selection (roulette wheel), tournament selection and ranking selection.   
We implemented 4 types of crossover: cycle crossover, partially matched crossover, corrected crossover and ordered crossover.    
Finally, for the mutation we implemented swap mutation, inversion mutation and scramble mutation.
